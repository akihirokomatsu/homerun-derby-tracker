# homerun-derby-tracker

# game rules
- each contestant (including myself) chooses 6 mlb players for the 2019 season
- at the end of the season, whoever has the greatest number of homeruns hit by their 6 players wins

# this repo is to...
- create a script that scrapes mlb.com player profiles and retrieves homerun counts
- script will tally up the total homeruns hit for each contestant
